In the Technicolor three-component system, light reflected from the subject matter is transmitted through the single lens of a special camera where it strikes a prism. One part of the light is passed through the prism and a green filter to produce a green record. The remainder of the light is reflected from the prism and absorbed by negatives to produce red and blue records. Each of the negatives is developed to produce new negatives which resemble black-and-white negatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
