Includes all standard sound 35 mm., 16 mm., and super 8 mm. film. Should be used even for silent films in which a space has been left for the inclusion of a sound track, i.e., where a full frame silent picture has been cropped to allow space for a sound track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4034,motionpicturefor:b,1,,,"nonanamorphic (wide-screen)",,,b,,,"Wide-screen effect without optically compressing the image or requiring the use of special projection techniques.",,,"Nonanamorphic wide-screen process is primarily associated with 35 mm. and larger film gauges where the image on the film is natural (not optically compressed) and of smaller frame height, which is expanded by projection on a wide screen through the use of normal lenses and the appropriate aperture plate to give the required aspect ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4035,motionpicturefor:c,1,,,3D,,,c,,,"Films which achieve a three-dimensional effect originally through the use of two projectors which superimpose two images of the film on the screen (usually a wide screen). It is usually associated with 35 mm. film. Polarized lenses worn by viewers help to create the impression of depth and dimension.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4036,motionpicturefor:d,1,,,"anamorphic (wide-screen)",,,d,,,"Films which achieve the wide-screen effect through the use of an image which is optically compressed or squeezed horizontally. It is then expanded to the correct proportions by projection on a wide screen with the use of special lenses that give greater magnification laterally than vertically.",,,"Introduced and adopted for commercial use in 1953 under the name of Cinemascope, followed by Techniscope (1963), Naturama, Panavision, etc. Also used for 16 mm. film which employs this process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imax format which is a non-rectangular, circular 180 degree limited use format that is not standardized. Imax may not technically be considered a wide-screen format because it does not have an aspect ratio, but it does achieve a wide-screen effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
